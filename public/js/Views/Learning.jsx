                I have adopted a lifestyle of lifelong learning. We live in a world of constant improvement, and with that comes the everlasting race of keeping up with new material.

                I recently attended Def Con, a hacker convention hosted in Las Vegas. It was incredibly enlightening, and as a beginner to networking and security, I still felt welcomed by attendees of all backgrounds. From a hardware security archtect at ARM to a newly hired Apple engineer, everyone was willing to reach down and help me. It was my first Def Con, and is won't be my last, that is for certain!
